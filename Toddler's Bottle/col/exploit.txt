1st step view the source code.
the length of para should be 20.
while hashcode(0x21DD09EC) equal to check_password(para), it pass
2ed step view the check_password func, it traslate the char* to int*,and each + 1 for 5 times. one int = four char. so we could input caculated para to pass it. Do it.
0x21DD09EC = 0x01010101 * 4 + 0x1DD905E8

Finally, use python output:
./col `python -c "print '\01'*16 + '\xe8\x05\xd9\x1d'"`
Tips: copy last line from windows notepad++, had a ANSI translate problem.
